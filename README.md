# Mokepon
A self made version of pokemon created with processingjs.  
For school we had to create a game using processingjs.  
Me and a friend decided to create a variant of pokemon using the pokemon essential graphics.  
While it was a project we made together, I did all the coding except for the menu.  

To see the menu press =  
It is possible to see the result at [No longer available]  
You will have to click on the canvas first so it's focused and backspace does not work in google chrome but you can use delete instead.  



Disclaimer: the images used or not my own and neither is the idea. It's based on pokemon and I'm not using it commercially whatsoever.  

After having done the project there are a couple things I could've done better.   
 The code could've been more compact I think if I used more functions and programmed a bit more OO.
 Also, I could've commented a bit more.  
   
 === 2019 Edit ===  
 If you really want to try this out, send a pull request with contact information in the README, it's probably not really worth it though.  
 The code should've definitely been split up in more files btw :')  
 I'm a bit embarrased by the code I have written..
