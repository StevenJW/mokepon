# Mokepon
A self made version of pokemon created with processingjs.

To see the menu press =
It is possible to see the result at o11006.hageveld2.nl/ProcessingJS/
You will have to click on the canvas first so it's focused and backspace does not work in google chrome but you can use delete instead.


Disclaimer: the images used or not my own and neither is the idea. It's based on pokemon and I'm not using it commercially whatsoever.
