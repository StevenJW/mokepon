# Mokepon
A self made version of pokemon created with processingjs.  
For school we had to create a game using processingjs.  
Me and a friend decided to create a variant of pokemon using the pokemon essential graphics.  
While it was a project we made together, I did all the coding except for the menu.  

To see the menu press =  
It is possible to see the result at [No longer available]  
You will have to click on the canvas first so it's focused and backspace does not work in google chrome but you can use delete instead.  


Disclaimer: the images used or not my own and neither is the idea. It's based on pokemon and I'm not using it commercially whatsoever.
